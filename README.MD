## WCAG Contrast Checker

The WCAG Contrast Checker is a simple JavaScript function that helps you determine if the contrast ratio between your foreground and background colors meets the WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards.

While there are other npm libraries available for this purpose, they require a Node.js environment. This function, however, is written in vanilla JS and can be used without any dependencies.

To-do:

-   Update README with documentation and usage.
